"Guess the Number" is a fun and interactive Java-based game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range (1 to 100). The game is designed to be simple yet engaging, providing feedback and scoring based on the player's performance.

Key Features

Random Number Generation:

The game starts by generating a random number between 1 and 100.
User Interaction:

Players are prompted to enter their guesses through a graphical user interface (GUI) using dialog boxes.
The program provides real-time feedback, indicating whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct.
Attempts Limitation:

Each player has a maximum of 10 attempts to guess the number, adding a challenge element to the game.
Scoring System:

Players earn points based on how quickly they guess the number. For example, the score decreases with each additional attempt, promoting quicker guesses.
Total scores are maintained across rounds, encouraging players to improve their performance.
Replayability:

After completing a round, players have the option to play again, enhancing engagement and replayability.
Input Validation:

The program ensures that user input is valid, handling non-numeric entries and guesses outside the defined range gracefully.
Exit Option:

Players can exit the game at any time, providing a user-friendly experience.
Use Cases
This project is ideal for beginners learning Java programming, as it covers fundamental concepts such as random number generation, loops, conditionals, and user input handling. It also serves as a fun way to practice programming skills while engaging with a simple game.

Potential Enhancements
Future improvements could include:

Introducing difficulty levels with varying ranges or attempts.
Keeping track of high scores or player statistics across multiple sessions.
Adding a timer for an added challenge.
Enhancing the GUI with more visual elements.
